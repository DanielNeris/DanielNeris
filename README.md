## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** with 7+ years of experience designing and building
**privacy-first, decentralized, and regulated financial systems**.

My work focuses on **backend architecture, event-driven systems, and Web3 infrastructure**,
operating at the intersection of **fintech, tokenization, P2P systems, and compliance**.
I’ve led projects end-to-end from **system design and smart contracts** to **APIs,
infrastructure, and production operations**.

I have hands-on experience building:
- **Tokenized asset platforms** and on-chain/off-chain financial systems  
- **KYC and identity verification flows** under regulatory constraints  
- **P2P and decentralized architectures**, balancing trust, privacy, and performance  

Currently exploring deeper topics around **event-driven architecture (Kafka)**,
**AWS cloud architecture**, and **privacy-preserving financial infrastructure**.

📍 Based in Dubai — open to global opportunities
